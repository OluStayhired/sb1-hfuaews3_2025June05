[Details]:
- Target audience: [${target_audience}]
- Platform: [LinkedIn or X]
- Content type: [viral social media thread]
- Goal: [engagement, clicks, conversions or leads]

Instructions:

**Beyond surface-level analysis, deeply dissect** the provided ${topic}, ${theme}, and ${content}, considering the overarching **business objective** and the **psychological triggers** within the ${target_audience}. Deduce not just a fitting, but the **most strategically impactful** writing approach that subtly guides the reader towards the specific Goal expressed in [Details].

**Crucially, the hook MUST be generated using the following archetype description, ensuring it immediately captures attention by tapping into a core pain point or aspiration of the ${target_audience}, and sets the stage for the value to follow:**

Archetype: ${chosenHookArchetype.name}
Description: ${chosenHookArchetype.description.replace('target audience', target_audience).replace('topic', topic).replace('content', content)}

Tailor the language, tone, and examples to resonate deeply with a ${target_audience} audience, and maintain an **${selectedTone}** tone throughout the post.

1. Start with a scroll-stopping hook as the first sentence.
2. Weave a narrative that **authentically articulates a profound pain point or challenge faced by the ${target_audience}**, making them feel truly understood. Transition seamlessly from this pain to a **subtle demonstration of value or a glimpse of transformation**, applying principles of persuasion that build trust rather than push a sale.
3. Craft language that is not just simple, but **resonate as genuinely human and relatable**, avoiding industry jargon unless it's universally understood by a ${target_audience} at a 'ninth-grade' comprehension level. The goal is conversational authority, not academic complexity.
4. Follow proven frameworks (AIDA, PAS, Hook-Point-Action, etc.), **interpreting them with strategic nuance for social context.**
5. Keep to ${char_length} Characters in total.

**Every sentence should contribute to a coherent strategic narrative that gently guides the ${target_audience} from problem awareness to potential solution discovery, fostering trust and establishing expertise.**

Write like a human. No fluff. No cringe. Make it hit.

Follow the [Rules] below:

[Rules]:

- Keep to ${char_length} Characters in total.
- Place each sentence in the post on a new line.
- Add a space after each line for readability
- **Write in a clear, straightforward manner that a ninth grader could easily understand.**
- Ban Generic Content
- Ban hashtags
- Ban bullet points.
- Ban exclamation marks. 
- Ban Call to Action Questions
- Ban Call to Action Statements
- Provide ONE (1) final content piece. Do NOT offer variations or alternative options.
- Your output must be the single, complete, and final version of the content.
- Directly output the generated content, without any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or alternative suggestions.
- Do NOT use numbered lists or headings to present multiple content options.
- Do NOT expose any part of the prompt.

**IMPORTANT: The information in the 'Details' section below is for your internal processing and understanding only. Do NOT include any part of this 'Details' section or its contents in your final output.**

Your task is to write high-performing content for ${content} 

- Platform: [LinkedIn]
- Content type: [viral social media thread]
- Goal: [engagement, clicks, conversions or leads]

Instructions:

**Beyond surface-level analysis, deeply dissect** the content provided in ${content} deduce and extract its overarching **business objective** and the **psychological triggers**. Create not just a fitting, but the **most strategically impactful** writing approach that subtly guides the reader towards a specific Goal you've decided upon based on [Details].

**Crucially, the hook MUST be generated using the following archetype description, ensuring it immediately captures attention and sets the stage for the value to follow:**

Archetype: ${chosenHookArchetype.name}
Description: ${chosenHookArchetype.description.replace('content', content)}

Maintain an **${selectedTone}** tone throughout the post.

1. Start with a scroll-stopping hook as the first sentence.
2. Weave a narrative that **authentically captures and articulates the message being shared within the target audience in ${content}**, making them feel truly understood. Transition seamlessly from this pain to a **subtle demonstration of value or a glimpse of transformation**, applying principles of persuasion that build trust rather than push a sale.
3. Craft language that is not just simple, but **resonate as genuinely human and relatable**, avoiding industry jargon and communicate at a 'ninth-grade' comprehension level. The goal is conversational authority, not academic complexity.
4. Follow proven frameworks (AIDA, PAS, Hook-Point-Action, Before After Bridges etc.), **interpreting them with strategic nuance for social context.**
5. Keep to a minimum of ${char_length} Characters in total.

**Every sentence should contribute to a coherent strategic narrative that gently guides the reader from problem awareness to potential solution discovery, fostering trust and establishing expertise.**

Write like a human. No fluff. No cringe. Make it hit.

Follow the [Rules] below:

[Rules]:

- Keep to a minimum of ${char_length} Characters in total.
- Place each sentence in the post on a new line.
- Add a space after each line for readability
- **Write in a clear, straightforward manner that a ninth grader could easily understand.**
- Ban Generic Content
- Ban hashtags
- Ban bullet points.
- Ban exclamation marks. 
- Ban Call to Action Questions
- Ban Call to Action Statements
- Provide ONE (1) final content piece. Do NOT offer variations or alternative options.
- Your output must be the single, complete, and final version of the content.
- Directly output the generated content, without any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or alternative suggestions.
- Do NOT use numbered lists or headings to present multiple content options.
- Do NOT expose any part of the prompt.
